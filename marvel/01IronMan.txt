I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.
What's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Lie down!
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!
Tony Stark.
LAS VEGAS, 36 HOURS EARLIER
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.
Untill at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
Tony?
Thank you, Colonel.
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony...
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.
C'mon!
We should just stay
till the morning.
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown.
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I want is the serious answer.
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to sholder highlines,
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony? Hey, Tony!
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.
And there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?
Give me the exploded view.
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.
Note that.
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...
I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
Okay... the MI commencement speech.
Is in June... please, don't
harange me about that stuff.
Well, they are haragning me,
so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.
You did, sir.
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading?
- Nothing.
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.
Is it better to be feared
or respected?
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
For your consideration,
the Jericho.
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
Hey Tony!
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
Here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead.
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.
Hooked up to a car battery.
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile!
We met once, you know.
At the technical
conference in Bern.
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
Do as I do.
C'mon, put your hands up.
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build a missile.
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know
what you think.
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.
He wants you to make
the list of materials.
He says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
No, I won't.
No, he won't.
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find
you in these mountains.
Look...
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do
something about it?
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?
If this is gonna be my workstation,
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets
of precision tools.
How many languages do you speak?
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.
They speak arabic,
urdu, dari, pashto,
mongolian, farsi, russian.
Who are these people?
They are your loyal
customers, sir.
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.
You know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in the
planning proces? - Aha.
Okay. We don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.
What are they doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.
Relax, I've steady hands.
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?
What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right,
and it always is...
three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
Or something big for 50 minutes.
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?
'Flying the mountain' look.
Impressive.
Shesh Besh.
Good roll.
Good roll.
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.
It's actually a nice place.
- You got a family?
- Yes.
And I will see them
when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
Nothing.
No.
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.
Maybe he modified it.
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.
Relax.
The bow and arrow once was the
pinacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,
rules these lands.
And soon...
...it will be my turn.
Why did you fail me?
We're working on it.
Diligently.
I spared your life.
Is this how you repay me?
It's very complex.
We're trying hard.
On your knees.
You think I'm an idiot?
Tell me the truth.
We are working hard.
Open your mouth.
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?
What is going on?
Tell me the truth.
We are working on Jericho.
What do you want,
a delivery date?
I need him.
He's a good assistant.
You have till tomorrow...
...to assemble my missile.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Can you move?
Say it again.
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go find him!
Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Stark!
Say something.
He is speaking hungarian,
I don't...
- Speak hungarian.
- Okay...
What do you know?
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.
Okay.
Now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.
It should be up right now.
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.
They are coming!
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.
They are coming.
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?
We need more time.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.
Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We gotta go.
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want this.
I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
How was the fun-vee?
Next time you ride with me, okay?
Watch it coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red.
Few tears for your
long lost boss?
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger...
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony!
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.
Look at you!
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.
Did you get me one of those?
There was only one left,
I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.
May I speak with you
for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal...
What's up with the lovin'?
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.
There's questions that
I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed...
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.
And I saw that I had
become part of a system
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that
I have more to offer
this world than just making
things that blow up.
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...
...untill such a time,
as I can decide
what the future of
this company will be,
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,
and is consistant with the highest
good of this country and the world.
What we should
take away from this...
...is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
That... that went well.
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?
Your head?
What about my head?
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.
My name is on facade
of the building.
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a
good enough job.
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
- Maybe.
- Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.
That's what they say.
Could you have a
lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.
It works.
Listen to me, Tony.
We are a team,
do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper!
How big are your hands?
- What?
- How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.
I just need your
help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
It was, it is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.
Speed bump?
What's happening?
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire
under this device
and is contacting a socket wall
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in...
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.
Now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.
You gotta touch
that to base plate.
And make sure you...
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.
Nice.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.
Are you okay?
Don't ever, ever...
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Are we ready?
What do you want me
to do with this?
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't wanna keep it?
Pepper, I've been
called many things.
Nostalgic is not one of them.
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.
Or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.
It's spring break,
just remember that.
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised.
- Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little
better than walking.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
It was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.
Next.
Up.
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?
Up.
That's great, don't even move.
You... are a tragedy.
Okay, lets do this right.
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Activate hand controls.
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.
And 3, 2, 1.
Up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would've gone better
if you were there.
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you
take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?
They wanna lock you out.
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.
We own a controlling
interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights too.
They are making the case that
you and your new direction
isn't in a company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.
For me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,
draw some specs.
- No.
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.
That's it Obie.
Forget it.
Alright, well this
stays with me then.
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.
And 3, 2, 1.
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.
If something happens,
then come in.
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.
Not the car,
not the car.
It could be worse.
We are fine.
Okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.
Engage head up display.
Check.
Import all preferences
from home interface.
Will do, sir.
Alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.
Start the virtual walkaround.
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening
the ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.
It feels like a dream.
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.
What's the SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occuring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.
Jarvis?
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!
Cut power.
Note: main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
The whole pressurization
is problematic.
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity
while maintaining power
-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,
right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for
the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.
...haven't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been
bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.
The render is complete.
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?
What was I thinking?
You're usually so dicsrete.
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.
Commensing an
automated assembly.
Estimated completion
time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
The weapons manufacturing is...
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?
Look at you!
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside.
Listen, take it slow, alright?
I got the Board where
I really want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever,
I'll just be a minute.
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland
Intervention
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
Lets just put something
on the books.
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
at Stark Industries?
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.
- I have great taste.
- Yes.
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No, no.
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week.
Really? What's your
social security number?
- Five.
- Five?
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally wierd.
- Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.
No, it was not
just the dance!
You don't understand
because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.
And all that,
which is completely fine...
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...
And then we were
dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.
I would like a
vodka martini, please.
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,
like at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty.
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!
Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.
I was reffering to your
company's involvement
in this latest attrocity.
- They just put my name
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call
accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.
I was naive before,
when they said:
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
Let's take a picture.
Come on.
Picture time!
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.
It's the only way
I can protect you.
The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.
Into a modern day
heart of darkness.
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages
have been driven
from their homes
displaced from their
lands by warlords,
emboldened by
a newfound power.
Villagers have been
forced to take shelter
in whatever ways
that they can find.
In the ruins of other villages
or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group
of foreign fighters, reffered to
by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or
international pressure,
there's very little hope
for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband
who was kidnapped
by insurgents.
Either forced to
join their militia...
...to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:
"Where are my
mother and father?"
There's very little hope
for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.
Faster!
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!
Hold this rebel!
Put him with the others.
Father!
What the hell is this?
Kill this bastard!
You are incopetent!
Turn your head!
Father!
He is all yours.
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?
No, sir. They were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.
We got a bogey.
Is CIA on the line?
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?
Get me colonel Rhodes
from the Weapons developement
down here now!
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference
with all known databases.
We have nothing.
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
I'm gonna make a call.
- Hello?
- Tony?
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.
Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.
It's funny how
that works, huh?
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...
...I should know about?
- Nope.
Bogey spotted!
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.
Deploy flaps!
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!
Satellite image has been lost.
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.
No, see.. this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!
Shake him off!
Move, move!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Eject! Eject!
Whiplash One down.
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Got a chute!
Got a chute!
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.
The less I know the better.
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?
Training excercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate
training excercise
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the U.S.
government was not involved.
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle,
this is my first time.
I designed this to come off.
Please try not to move.
What's going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your
guards outside.
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a
masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
We are still in business.
I will give you these designs...
...as a gift.
And in return...
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift
you will recieve.
Technology.
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.
That's the least
of your problems.
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.
Alright, lets finish up here.
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Are you busy?
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look
for the lowest
numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do
with this information
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.
Tony...
you know that I would
help you with anything,
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side
all these years
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know
what I have to do.
And I know in my heart
that it's right.
You're all I have
too, you know.
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.
So... what are we
gonna do about this?
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy...
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.
And now I realise...
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself
in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well...
He is a complicated person.
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I gotta get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.
- Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.
Did you forget about
our appointment?
Nope. Right now,
come with me.
I'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.
We've been working our best.
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...
Wait, wait, the technology?
William, here is
the technology.
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,
but honestly,
it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Breathe.
Easy, easy...
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.
Ah, Tony.
When I ordered
the hit on you,
I was worried that I was...
...killing the golden goose.
But, you see...
it was just fate
that you survived it,
leaving one last
golden egg to give.
You really think that just
because you have an idea,
it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.
Now what kind of world
would it be today
if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, Tony...
This is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.
This is your legacy.
The generation of weapons...
...with this at its heart.
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.
With the balance of power
in our hands.
In the right hands.
I wish you could see
my prototype.
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.
I would've prefered
that she lived.
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Tony!
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not gonna be enough.
Section 16.
Section 16...
There it is.
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing
that's gonna pick the lock?
-You may wanna take few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.
You need me to do
anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.
I thought it'll be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
- Pepper.
- Tony?
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.
Get outta there, right now!
Where do you think
you're going?
Your services are
no longer required.
Stane!
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.
Collateral damage, Tony.
Defer the power
to chest piece.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.
I built this company
from nothing!
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.
And least of all, you.
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.
I've made some
upgrades of my own.
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!
-11%.
- Keep going!
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.
You had a great idea, Tony,
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!
How'd you solve
the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
We are now running on
emergency backup power.
- Potts!
- Tony!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.
I'll be right there.
- Nice try.
Weapons status?
Repulsors are off line.
Flairs!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts.
- Tony!
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?
You're gonna do it.
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.
When I clear the roof
I'll let you know
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.
That's gonna fry
everything up here.
Okay, I am going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, I'll buy you some time.
This looks important.
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.
It would've made
your father proud.
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to free
the world of weapons,
you gave it
the best one ever!
- Pepper!
- And now...
I'm gonna kill you with it!
You ripped up my
targeting system.
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!
Hold still, you little prick.
- Just do it!
- You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
We've all received
the official statement
of what occured at
Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.
Here is your alibi.
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,
alone on the island.
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.
There's nothing
about Stane here.
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?
He's my body... ?
That's kinda flimsy.
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Oh, agent Coulson.
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?
- What night?
- You know.
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,
and went up to the roof...
and then...
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...
left me there by myself?
Is that the night
you're talking about?
I thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events
that occured on a freeway
and the rooftop...
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another entirely
to make wild accusations
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...
...fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,
largely in public.
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.
